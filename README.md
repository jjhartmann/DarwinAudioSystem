Simple Audio Convolution Software


Created with JUCE, this software takes in two audio files. 
It then convolves the two audio files together using an FFT iterative algorithm. 

The result is the convolved output of the two files. This can create some interesting
soundscapes and textures depending on what files are convolved. 

Look to ---> www.jeremyhartmann.com 

Most of my recent electroacoustic 
material uses convolved audio.
